"""
Real Disease Classification Server
--------------------------------------
Loads the trained MobileViT checkpoint (checkpoints/mobilevit_best.pt)
and serves it over a simple local HTTP endpoint. The Flutter app calls
this instead of on-device inference - this sidesteps adding another
native Android dependency (pytorch_lite/tflite/onnxruntime) on top of
an already fragile NDK/build setup, and reuses the same HTTP-call
pattern already working for the Gemini AI Assistant.

Run this BEFORE running the Flutter app:
    python inference_server.py

Then connect your phone (same USB cable used for `flutter run`) with:
    adb reverse tcp:8000 tcp:8000

This makes "localhost:8000" on the PHONE actually reach this server
running on your COMPUTER, over the same USB cable - no WiFi network
config needed, and it works identically whether phone and computer
share a network or not.
